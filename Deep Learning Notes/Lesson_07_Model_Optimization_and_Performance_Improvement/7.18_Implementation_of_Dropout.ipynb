They are 'dropped out' randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass, and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.\n","\n","\n","- If neurons are randomly dropped out of the network during training, other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons. This is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network.\n","\n","- The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This, in turn, results in a network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to overfit the training data.\n","\n","Let's understand how it works.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Steps to be followed:\n","1.
